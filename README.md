* Wordle is a word guessing game. You can play it [here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) too.
* THe goal of the game is to guess a 5-letter word which will be randomly generated from `words.txt` File.
* Using if conditions, It will check if the n-th index was in the word or not. If not, that letter will be gray and if yes then the letter will be yellow. If the n-th index matches with the n-th index of the secret word, then that letter will be green
* it will import some converters from `Emojies.py` and then use it in the for loops to change the letters to discord emotes.
* This command also uses the `wait_for()` function.
* Get the emotes from [This repo](https://github.com/SOULwasTaken1/Discord-Wordle-bot) if your bot cant use the ones i have provided. You will need to get the Emote IDs and then put them in `Emojies.py`
